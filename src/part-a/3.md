# Part 3. Creating bash scripts for checking outputs and deleting files

## 8.
In order to make it easier to check the outputs of your jobs, we will write a shell script to perform the commands from Step 35 in Lab 2:

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ nano checkfiles.sh
```

Copy and paste the following into the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Number of hkl files"
find . -name "*.hkl" | grep -v -e spiketrain -e mountains | wc -l

echo "Number of mda files"
find mountains -name "firings.mda" | wc -l

echo "Time taken (s)"
tail pipe-slurm*.out
```

## 9.
Run your shell script from the `/data/picasso/20181105` directory to make sure you are able to get the same output as in the last lab:

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ cd /data/picasso/20181105

(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 20181105] $ bash /data/src/PyHipp/checkfiles.sh
```

## 10.
We will also create a shell script to remove the files created during the last run:

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 20181105] $ cd -

(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ nano removefiles.sh
```

Copy and paste the following into the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

find . -name "*.hkl" -or -name "*.csv" | xargs rm

find . -name "*slurm*err" -or -name "*slurm*out" | xargs rm

rm -r mountains

cd session01

rm binData.hdf logs.txt slist.txt VirtualMaze*

cd ..
```

## 11.
Use the script to remove the files created during the last run:

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 PyHipp] $ cd -

(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 20181105] $ bash /data/src/PyHipp/removefiles.sh
```

Run the checkfiles shell script again to check that the files have been removed.
