# Part 4. Executing the parallel processing pipeline

## 12.
We can now submit both jobs from the day directory:

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 20181105] $ sbatch /data/src/PyHipp/rplparallel-slurm.sh

(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 20181105] $ sbatch /data/src/PyHipp/rplsplit-slurm.sh
```

## 13.
Once the jobs start running, you can check what is happening in real time by using the following command:

```shell
(env1) [ec2-user@ip-10-0-5-43 20181105] $ tail -f *.out
```
which will display new lines as they appear in the .out files.
